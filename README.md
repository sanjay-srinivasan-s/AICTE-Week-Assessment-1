## 🌾 Crop Recommendation System:
This project is a simple machine learning-based crop recommendation system. It predicts the most suitable crop to grow based on various soil and climate conditions such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium content, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

## 📚 Overview:
The model uses a classification approach to suggest the most appropriate crop. It leverages supervised machine learning techniques, specifically decision tree classifiers, trained on a dataset containing labeled crop information.

## 📁 Project Structure:
Crop_Recomandestion.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Sanjay S(Week 1 Assignment ).docx: An explanatory document outlining basic ML concepts such as supervised learning, classification, and regression.

## 🛠️ Features:
Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.

Use of DecisionTreeClassifier for model training.

Evaluation using accuracy and classification report.

Easy-to-understand crop suggestions based on input parameters.

## 🧠 Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Input Parameters:
The model requires the following input features:

N: Nitrogen content in soil

P: Phosphorus content in soil

K: Potassium content in soil

Temperature (°C)

Humidity (%)

pH: Acidity/alkalinity of the soil

## 🚀 Future Improvements:
Integrate with a web interface or mobile app.

Expand dataset with more diverse regions and crop types.

Use ensemble models or deep learning for better accuracy.
